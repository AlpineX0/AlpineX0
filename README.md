My name is AlpineX0 and I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. Here you will find some of my personal and team projects that showcase my programming skills and passion for mathematics.

## About Me

I've always had a strong interest in mathematics and programming, so naturally, I decided to study Computer Science. Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, playing video games, and watching documentaries. My favorite programming language is Java but I also have experience with C and Assembly.

## Projects

### Team Project - `Thermal Terrain Imaging`
```
This is a team project aimed at developing a system that uses thermal imaging technology to map 
the temperature variations of different terrains. The objective is to create a comprehensive and 
accurate thermal map that can be used in various fields, such as agriculture, geology, and environmental studies. 
The project involves designing and building a custom hardware system that can capture and process thermal images, 
as well as developing software to interpret and analyze the data collected by the system. The team will work together 
to optimize the system's performance and accuracy, and ultimately produce a highly useful tool for researchers and 
professionals.
```
### Personal Project - `Mathematical Expression Interpreter`
```
Inspired by my love for mathematics, I created a project that evaluates mathematical expressions. 
The implementation is in Java and it handles basic arithmetic, parentheses, exponentiation, and 
other mathematical functions. This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my skills 
in object-oriented programming and algorithm design.
